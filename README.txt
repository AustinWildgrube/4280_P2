The FSA table is in the scanner.cpp file and starts on line 38. I am also counting lines.

This program is the scanner for our compiler. It accepts characters and checks to see if they are tokens of our
language.

To make the project just simply type "make" in the directory.
To clean this project just simply type "make clean" in the directory.

Usage: scanner
Usage: scammer [fileName].fs

For example: ./scanner [fileName].fs

This program ONLY accepts .fs files.

An example file is included and can be ran using the command:
./scanner test_data.fs

My Github repo for this is private, and if you would like access I am more than happy to open it or add you as a member.
